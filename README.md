# secure-password-generator
## Description
DU Coding Bootcamp Homework 3.

For this assigment, I created a password generator by setting variables and manipulating them with a function. The function contains if statements to log the user's responses to prompt and confirm messages. These responses create a string of valid characters. The function also contains a for loop that controls the function of the generator. The loop has the generator consider the user's numerical response for password length and pick that number of random characters from the string of valid characters.  

## Screenshot
This is a screenshot of the generator's output when the user has specified a 128 character password with numbers and uppercase letters as the valid characters.
